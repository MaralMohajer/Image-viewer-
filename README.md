I have written this code for editing images in Java.
With this program, you can perform tasks like changing the size of the image, adjusting the brightness, and converting the image to grayscale.
# How to use
To use the program's features, you first need to select an image from your laptop's memory and edit it by choosing your desired option.
In the brightness adjustment section, you should enter a number between 0 and 1. The larger the number, the higher the brightness level.
In the resize section, you should enter two numbers as the length and width of the image. The image will be displayed in the size you specify.
By pressing the gray scale button, the image will be displayed to you in black and white.
